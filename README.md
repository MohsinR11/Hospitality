## üìù Overview
This project delivers a **comprehensive data visualization solution** for the hospitality sector, focusing on **key performance indicators (KPIs)**.  
It provides an intuitive interface for tracking **financial performance, operational efficiency, and booking patterns**, helping managers and stakeholders make informed strategic decisions.
